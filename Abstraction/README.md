## What is Abstraction ?
<br>  Abstraction is the concept of object-oriented programming that “shows” only essential attributes and “hides” unnecessary information.The primary purpose of using my abstract ancestor classes is to obtain loose couple classes.Another purpose of not using abstract classes is to set rules for my subclasses. If we think from this perspective, we can think that we have signed a contract between subclasses and Upperclasses.The purpose of abstract classes is to inherit. Instances are not removed from abstract classes. We assign rules to be followed in subclasses to abstract classes.Abstract classes cannot be marked as static . Because static classes do not inherit, they do not inherit.Methods marked as abstract do not have bodies.Because these methods must be implemented in subclasses.We have to override a method in a subclass.
