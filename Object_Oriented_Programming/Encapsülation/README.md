## Encaps√ºlation 

When we want external access to any member of the Class, we use encapsulation when we want to access indirectly in line with a certain condition.
<br> When we want to control access, we manipulate get and set methods to properties.
<br> When we want to get the value held on the property, we use the get method, and when we want to assign a value, we use the set method.

<br> private int _age;    //  we closed access
