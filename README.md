## Object_Oriented_Programming

## What is OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)?
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is the core ingredient of the .NET framework.OOP (object-oriented programming) is a programming paradigm that is completely based on ‘objects’. We can created  our object we need  into application .We defined the object into class . We dont write again and again through OOP .We create an object from the object ptototype (instance)
<br>  **Object**
<br> Object is a collection of number of entities. Objects take up space in the memory. Objects are instances of classes. When a program is executed , the objects interact by sending messages to one another. Each object contain data and code to manipulate the data. Objects can interact without having know details of each others data or code.

## What are the benefits of oop?
<br> 1-Classes are created once
instead of rewriting long codes, it can be run with short encodings.
<br> 2- Dreatly reduces the waste of time.
<br> 3- If you want to change your project , you dont write all project code . .You can change class code 
<br> 4- OOP is faster and easier to execute
<br> 5-OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
<br> 6- OOP helps to keep the C# code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
<br> 7-OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time
